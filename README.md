Individuals or teams will work through and adapt the questions presented in the climate notebook to reproduce key indicators of climate change, similar to NASA's <https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs>.  Our primary objective is to reproduce the famous 'hockey-stick' curve first reported in _Nature_ ([Mann et al 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/33859 "Mann, M., Bradley, R. & Hughes, M. Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries. Nature 392, 779–787 (1998). https://doi.org/10.1038/33859")) using the most recent observations and most extensive ice core data.  Along the way we will encounter many other datasets and learn about wrangling the diverse conventions in tabular data.

   
- Use the [github-login.ipynb](github-login.ipynb) notebook in JupyterLab to authenticate each session with GitHub.  This provides a short-lived and appropriately scoped token for secure access using `gh-scoped-creds`.  
- We use GitHub Actions to run automated reproducibility checks, click the badge up top for details.
